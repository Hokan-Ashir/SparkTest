1.	Use dataset (web-server access log)

3.	Add Spark Unit tests for your Job (and make #2 screenshot with ‘green’ tests)

Use accumulators to get stats how many users of IE, Mozzila or Other were detected (parse it from UserAgent: ip13 - - [24/Apr/2011:04:41:53 -0400] "GET /logs/access_log.3 HTTP/1.1" 200 4846545 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)") and print them in STDOUT of Driver (make #3 screenshot)
